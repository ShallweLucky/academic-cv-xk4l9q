abstract: The doping effect of the Sn atom in indium tin oxide (ITO) plays a crucial role in influencing the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) behaviors and the
related nonlinear optical properties. A ternary (In1xSnx)2O3 film is fabricated by high-throughput magnetron sputtering technique. The rela-tionship
between Sn doping and second harmonic generation (SHG) enhancement is systematically interpreted through comprehensive char-acterization
of structural and optical properties. Significantly, clear microstructural changes associated with different levels of Sn doping are
identified by x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. These changes directly contribute to shifts in the ENZ wavelength (kENZ). The results
indicate that the optimal region for SHG enhancement lies within 7.3â€“10.6 at. % Sn doping. Moreover, it is demonstrated that kENZ can be
adjusted by manipulating the formation of electrically inactive defect clusters via Sn substitution at the 24d sites. This study not only provides
valuable insight into the mechanism linking Sn doping and SHG enhancement of ITO but also exemplifies the high-throughput exploration
of optical functional materials.
